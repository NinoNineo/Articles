                    <p>
                        The famous Hercule Poirot has to deal with an unusual killer - he invites the little Belgian to a competition with letters, and his signature has only three letters: A, B, C. He has planned the murders in places whose names follow the alphabetical order. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet. Is he going to reach the last letter?! Who is better than whom - a smart killer or a professional detective? Poirot will have to solve the killer's plan.
